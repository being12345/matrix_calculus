# matrix_calculus
This is including most useful matrix calculus material
**Knowing how them work is very important**
1. 向量运算.pdf will help you to learn basic rules and principles for example taking partial derivative, chain rule and so on. Always present $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_{ij}}$  as a part of Jacobi matrix if x is a matrix and then mix them together.
2. 矩阵运算.pdf help you to know regular computing in deep learning for example $W*X$ . so remember them.
